A Turing pattern is a process in biology that describes how patterns (such as stripes or spots) can emerge from seemingly random chemical distributions. This process involves diffusion rates and the interaction between two or more chemicals, namely an activator and an inhibitor of a phenotype. 

This model uses two competing chemicals, an activator and an inhibitor. The activator is an exciter for the production of its inhibitor, and the inhibitor has a higher diffusion rate than the activator. This means that where there are high concentrations of the activator, there will be the expression of a certain phenotype and there will also be more production of the inhibitor. Because the inhibitor has a higher diffusion rate, it will diffuse into the surround area faster than the activator, and inhibit the expression of the phenotype. This creates a spotted pattern.

In the specie_list.hpp file, we have four species declared: inhibitor, activator, inhibitor_dt, and activator_dt. The two dt species are to help with modeling there relative diffusion rates. There are six total reactions declared in the reactions_list.hpp file, two synthesis reactions, two delta concentration reactions, and two diffusion reactions. The activator synthesis function takes one activator_dt species, and creates both one activator molecule and one inhibitor_dt species. This means that when more activator molecules are created, there is an increase in the amount of inhibitor that could be made. In the model_imple.hpp file, the reaction rates of both diffusion reactions is determined by the molecules concentration in neighboring cells. Therefore, if there is a high concentration of the activator in the surrounding cells, then there will be an increase in the amount of activator in the cell and a decrease in the surrounding cells. The param_sets.csv file was created without the parameter search method, so they are just best estimates. The simulation was run with the following commands:

$ ./simulation -p ./param_sets.csv -c 100 -w 100 -t 10 -u 0.5 -e "output.csv"
