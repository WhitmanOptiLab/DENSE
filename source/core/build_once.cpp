 * heterogeneous execution.

//Needed because without it, compilation of active rate functions on which
//  determ_context methods depend won't be triggered

//Needed because the context methods need to be cross-compiled for either CPU or GPU
// execution, and their function signatures won't be the same in the two variants, which
// would cause problems.
