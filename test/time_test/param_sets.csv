# CSV Specification
#   Ignored by the file readers are:
#     (1) empty cells / blank rows / whitespace
#     (2) comment rows which always begin with a '#'
#     (3) any cell that does not begin with a numerical or decimal place character*
#   *Such cells act as either column headers or other important notes. These are provided for the user's convenience and can be modified if the user sees fit.
# None of these comments include commas because it messes with the column widths when loaded into Excel-like programs. Speaking of that...
# For best results delete all comments before loading this file into any Excel-like program.
# Scientific notation in the form of 3.14e-41 is supported.
# It is futile to add/remove/modify the column headers with the expectation of changing the program's behavior. Data must be entered in the default order or must match the ordering of a respective command line argument.
# Rename this file by removing the "_template" from the file name (or just change the name entirely) once the data has been entered!
