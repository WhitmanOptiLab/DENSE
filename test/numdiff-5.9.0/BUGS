Bug reports have to be sent to the address
<ivprimi(at)libero(dot)it> . Please, put Numdiff
in the subject and indicate the version of the operating system you
are running (in particular, do not forget to specify if
it is a 32- or a 64-bit system), and, if you know it, 
the version of the compiler used to build Numdiff.
Please write also whether your version of Numdiff uses the
GNU MP library or not.
Before writing an email be sure to run the latest
stable version of Numdiff, I do not provide
support for older versions.

Known issues
============

Numdiff cannot be successfully installed if the target directory chosen
for the installation is a directory whose path includes one or more spaces.
This is not an issue of Numdiff but of GNU shtool, which is used to
perform the installation in a portable way.
Thanks to Tim Jenness for having reported this problem.
